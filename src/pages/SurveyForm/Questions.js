/**
 * Survey Questions Configuration
 * ------------------------------
 * This file defines the structure and metadata for each survey question displayed in the SurveyForm.
 * Each object in the `Questions` array represents a question field rendered dynamically in the form.
 *
 * Field Properties:
 * - `name` (string): Unique key used for form value binding.
 * - `label` (string): The display name shown to the user.
 * - `type` (string): Defines the form input type. Supported values:
 *     - "text": Single-line text input.
 *     - "textarea": Multi-line text area input.
 *     - "radio": Single-choice selection (uses `options` array).
 *     - "multiselect": Multiple-choice selection. Supports optional entry.
 *     - "textmultiselect": Combination of text entry and multiselect (custom implementation).
 *     - "toolSelection": Special grouped multiselect input where options are grouped by categories.
 * - `description` (string | JSX): Tooltip or guidance shown under or beside the label.
 * - `options` (string[] | groupedOption[]): Required for types like "radio", "multiselect", and "toolSelection".
 * - `includeOtherOptions` (boolean): (multiselect only) If true, an additional input ("Other:") will be displayed.
 *
 * Special Type Behaviours:
 * - `toolSelection`: Structured as categories with sub-options:
 *     {
 *       id: "data_pipelines",
 *       label: "Data Pipelines/Platforms",
 *       options: ["Databricks", "Data Factory", ...]
 *     }
 * 
 * JSX descriptions (e.g., with <TooltipWord />) are supported and rendered accordingly.

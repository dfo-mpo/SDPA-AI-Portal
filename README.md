- **CSV/PDF Analyzer**: Analyzes and extracts information from PDF documents by uploading the document along with a CSV file containing engineered prompts.
- **Sensitivity Score Calculator**: Computes the sensitivity level of uploaded documents based on custom parameters.
- **Redactor**: Scans and redacts specific information from uploaded PDF documents.
  
## Integration with Azure AI and Document Intelligence
### Azure AI
We utilize Azure AI to power the AI ChatBot and CSV/PDF Analyzer. Azure AI provides advanced machine learning models that can interpret and respond to user queries, and analyze text data extracted from documents. This integration allows for:
- Enhanced natural language processing for real-time conversation with documents.
- Sophisticated data extraction and analysis from CSV and PDF files, enabling deep insights into document contents.

### Document Intelligence
Document Intelligence is used to read and interpret the contents of documents uploaded to the web application. It helps in:
- Automatically extracting text and data from structured and unstructured documents.
